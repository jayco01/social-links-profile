## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pseudo-classes
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use pseudo-classes, `white-space: nowrap;`, and how to make `<a>` elements act as buttons. I also improved my understanding of styling interactive elements properly.

### Challenges

I struggled with making the text inside an `<a>` tag change color when clicking on the button. I didnâ€™t initially realize that I needed to make the `<a>` tag a block element to occupy the entire container. Aligning `<a>` elements and working with pseudo-classes also took some trial and error.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped me find the necessary information to resolve issues related to pseudo-classes and `<a>` elements.
